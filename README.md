# monadic-typechecker
This repository contains the artifact for the paper [Developing a
Monadic Type Checker for an Object-Oriented Language](paper.pdf).
The design is based on the compiler for the language
[Encore](https://github.com/parapluu/encore), but the language has
been simplified to make the presentation more clean.

This documentation will be improved soon!
