# monadic-typechecker
This repository contains the artifact for the paper [Developing a
Monadic Type Checker for an Object-Oriented Language](paper.pdf).
The design is based on the compiler for the language
[Encore](https://github.com/parapluu/encore), but the language has
been simplified to make the presentation more clean.

The latest version of the source code can be found in
[typechecker](typechecker) directory. There is also a snapshot of
the artifact as submitted to SLE'19 in the [artifact](artifact)
directory. This artifact contains a detailed walkthrough of the
source code.
